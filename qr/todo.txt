- split up the index.html
- match the language and light/dark mode of the main site
- connect the two sites [dependent on the main website getting the logic update]
- add "advanced" section(the generation settings/resolution)
- add option to have the url autofill all the fields (input, settins, etc) [partially dependent on me fixing the dns routing]
